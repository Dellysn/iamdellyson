It‚Äôs been a couple of years since I started coding officially, at least. I have always been attracted to the backend side, digging and roughing it with `Node.js` and some of its framework, I never really worked on any realistic project, no clients either. This may be as a result of my impostor syndrome, or something I am not so sure that I know about. I have attempted to work on startups with my friends, but I ended up giving an excuse or the project just fold up and died a natural death.

## The Hard Truth

Even though I really love the logics that goes on the backend, no doubt the Frontend has been fascinating to me all along, the aestheticism that goes on the Frontend all has me hooked up. It's just that my ego won‚Äôt let me. I picked up some `React.js` learning resources and later dropped them because I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù `React.js` it was so cumbersome I would say at the time, then I switched back to learning an alternative `Svelte.js`. A frontend framework that can be used to ‚ÄúCybernetically enhanced web apps‚Äù according to [Harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris).

## The Journey to becoming a Frontend Developer

Shortly after picking up one or two YouTube tutorials on `Svelte.js`. I was already building some practice projects with this interesting framework, then boom I got a call from a long-time friend asking he would like me to work on a project, a landing page of a business. At the time I had decided not to continue with just HTML and CSS, I wanted to be able to modularize my code and reuse it whenever I want, `Svelte` just like `React.js` provides that out of the box. I had initially built some websites `Svelte.js`. I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the delivery at the time because SvelteJS has no officially recommended routing options like `react-router` is to ReactJS, I always opted for a library like [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/), and [Tinro](https://madewithsvelte.com/tinro) for routing in `Svelte.JS`, and trust me it's been the best option so far, for me at least. Thank goodness for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) although, I am yet to try it out, I have a good feeling about it.

## What‚Äôs up with Reactjs and why Reactjs?

Well, thank me for asking me these questions, one would think that after this wonderful adventure with `Svelte`. I should be comfortable using it in any other projects that I am going to be executing, but the reality is that even though I never really liked `React.js` for some personal reasons, LOL. I am just kidding, but the fact is I never really had any time dedicated to learning ReactJS, but I love JavaScript.

On a hot afternoon, representing my favorite club in the EA FIFA game, thrashing my opponents by some huge margin.

I received a call from my mentor ‚Äúagain‚Äù, this time he wanted me to work on a `React.js` project, a landing page for an App. Remember, I had no solid knowledge of `React` prior, the only concept I am familiar with was how to create a component, the idea of `props` in **React** was strange, and it was difficult to think about at the time. I had no choice but to say yes as I love to learn and why not?.

Taking on that project has been a life-changing adventure for me because it serves as a boost to my progress which had also landed me some various gigs that I can confidently add to my portfolio. The interesting part is that I learned on the job, not wasting time and days watching ‚Äúuseful tutorials‚Äù on YouTube and/or any tutorial websites out there. What has helped me was the fact that whenever I run into issues or there is any bug in my code, I referred back to Google, read some blog posts to help me get some ideas on how to fix the said issues, and at this point, I can confidently say that I am in love with **React**? In fact, I am having a second thought about going back to Svelte because of the following reasons:

- The [React.js Community](https://dev.to/t/react) is massive.

- There are lots of resources out there to guide you in your learning.

## What's the point?

This post is out of excitement, the way I feel about my progress right now and I just feel like letting my readers know what being a Software Developer is to me and understand that the journey so far has been a rough one, and they should understand that you can anything learning even on the job. I am unemployed, and I am currently not searching, as I am taking my time out to face my studies.

Au revoir et paix. ü§û
